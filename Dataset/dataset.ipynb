    ### Summary of the dataset

### Dataset Overview: Disease Symptom Prediction

The "datasetDiseaseSymptomPrediction.csv" dataset serves as a valuable resource for predicting diseases based on various symptoms reported by patients. It provides a structured approach to understanding the relationship between symptoms and potential diseases.

### Key Aspects:
- **Disease Identification**: Each row contains the name of a specific disease, allowing for straightforward classification.
- **Symptom Representation**: The dataset includes up to 17 columns dedicated to individual symptoms, capturing a comprehensive range of clinical manifestations associated with each disease.

### Structure:
- **Rows**: Each entry corresponds to a unique instance, detailing one disease and its related symptoms.
- **Columns**:
  - **1 Column**: Disease name.
  - **17 Columns**: Symptoms, which may include conditions like itching, vomiting, and fatigue. Some symptom columns may be empty if a symptom does not apply.
### Purpose:
The primary aim of this dataset is to support the creation of predictive models that assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing diseases by analyzing reported symptoms. This can improve diagnostic accuracy and patient care by leveraging data-driven insights.

### Sample table before clean dataset:

### Key Observations:

1. **Disease Identification**: Each row clearly identifies a specific disease.
2. **Symptom Variety**: Up to 17 symptoms are associated with each disease, indicating diverse clinical presentations.
3. **Missing Data**: Some symptom columns are empty, suggesting not all symptoms apply universally.
4. **Predictive Potential**: The dataset is structured for machine learning, aiding in disease prediction based on symptoms.
5. **Common Symptoms**: Certain symptoms, such as **itching**, appear across multiple diseases (e.g., **Fungal Infection** and **Jaundice**), indicating possible overlaps in clinical presentations.

### Explanation of the Code and Recurring Symptoms

This code analyzes and compares a raw dataset with a cleaned version, focusing on key summary statistics.

1. **Summary Statistics**:
   - **Raw Data**: Displays the number of rows, columns, and missing values.
   - **Cleaned Data**: Shows the same metrics after cleaning, highlighting improvements in data quality.

2. **Recurring Symptoms**:
   - In the **raw dataset**, recurring symptoms may appear with duplications and inconsistencies.
   - After cleaning, the **cleaned dataset** presents a clearer view of these symptoms, allowing for more accurate analysis of patterns and relationships essential for diagnosis.
